# Retail-Sales-Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting retail sales using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical sales data and various features, the goal is to develop a model that accurately forecasts future sales for better business decision-making.

Features 

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and visualize key trends to inform the modeling process.

## Feature Engineering: Create relevant features or transform existing ones to enhance model performance.

## Model Development: Implement machine learning algorithms such as regression, time series analysis, or deep learning to build a robust sales prediction model.

## Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics, and fine-tune as needed for optimal results.

## Deployment: If applicable, deploy the model in a production environment for real-time predictions.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)
